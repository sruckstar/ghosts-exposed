The mod adds a mini-game to search for ghosts.

At night in an abandoned motel Sandy Shores becomes turbulent. The Ghosts Exposed team asks you to gather evidence of the existence of paranormal phenomena. Find as many ghosts as possible before dawn by taking pictures of them on your iFruit camera.

The mini-game can be run from 2am to 4am. On the map, the start of the mission is marked with a ghost icon.
